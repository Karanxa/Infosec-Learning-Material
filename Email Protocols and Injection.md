# Email Protocol

## SMTP

### SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

- SMTP Servers act like post boxes for our emails. They are used to send and receive emails over the internet

	- Sender's SMTP Server

		- Outgoing Server Config - smtp.gmail.com ( when sending mail from gmail )

## IMAP

### IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol

- This protocol is used to load emails received on our smtp mail server, while keeping all devices in sync and loading cache email copies on each devices
- As mostly only the cache of the original email is loaded from the mail server. We need internet to load emails.

	- It keeps the original email on the email server.

## POP3

### POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3

- This protocol is used to load emails received on our smtp mail server, but in this case it only loads the inbox of the email server. This protocol is not in sync with all the other devices on which the mail server is being used
- We can loaded emails again , without accessing internet.

	- Once an email is loaded from email server. email is deleted from the email server and is only available on the device from which it was loaded.
